  <string name="tutorial_buy_sell_content">Trade Price* is set to the market ask price when buying, and the bid price when selling. This is to
    simulate Market Order type transactions. For some stocks, we don\'t have ask and bid data. For these stocks, we use the last traded price of the
    stock.\n\nTrade Quantity is limited to 20% of Average Daily Volume or Current Day Volume, whichever is higher. Your Trade Value may be limited due
    to this constraint.\n\n*Price is delayed as specified by financial exchanges or our data providers.
